# friend-finder

This is a Heroku web app that will match the user with the closest match to their political beliefs. This app is currently in development.

Once the development is complete, this app will work as follows:

Navigate to the [friend finder] (https://friend-finder-msd.herokuapp.com/)
Click the button to begin the quiz, then answer the questions and submit.
In it's current form, the app will send the new user to the friends array.

Once complete, this app will match the user to their closest match and display them as a modal.

This app was developed by Mike Damanskis as part of the UCLA Web Development Boot Camp. He can be reached at MikeDamanskis@gmail.com.
